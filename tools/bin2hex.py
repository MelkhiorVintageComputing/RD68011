"""Flat MC68010 image to one big-endian word per line, for $readmemh.

    python3 tools/bin2hex.py build/programs/p01_flow.bin > p01_flow.hex

The memory model in sim/models/rd68011_slave.sv is word-wide and indexed by
the address's upper bits, so its contents are exactly this file: word zero
first, most significant byte first inside each word, which is the order an
MC68010 reads them in.

The image is padded to a whole number of words and rejected if it will not fit
the model, because a program that silently wrapped round would be a very
confusing failure.
